**Hello!  I'm Hank ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a self-taught programmer who started out coding by developing my own audio and MIDI-editing software, which lead to learning JavaScript, which lead to developing webapps, which led to...well, you know how it goes.  I recently finished a batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), where I focused on improving my skills in React.js, learning Typescript, and studying algorithms/data structures by paring with other Recursers.  

- ðŸ““ Currently studying: PostgreSQL, user authentication in React
- ðŸ‘½ Interested in: JavaScript, React, TypeScript, D3, Web Development, Generative/Algorithmic music
- âœ‹ Looking for work as a **Full-Stack or Front-end developer**

**Here are some things I've built**

ðŸ‘® [knowyourcops.com](https://knowyourcops.com) - An interactive database of thousands of civilian complaints filed against the NYPD from 1985 - 2019, featuring interactive maps, charts, and graphs that visualize the data and break it down by individual officers and precincts.
